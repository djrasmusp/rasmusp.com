# Hi there! I'm Rasmus
I’m a full-stack developer with a passion for building seamless and engaging web experiences. I enjoy navigating the space between elegant frontends and solid backend architecture—bringing ideas to life with both creativity and precision.

Driven by curiosity and a love for lifelong learning, I’m always exploring new technologies and sharing insights with others.<br>
When I’m not immersed in code, you’ll likely find me diving into the latest tech trends, you’ll find me experimenting in the kitchen, watching a good film, or simply enjoying the little moments that make life great.
