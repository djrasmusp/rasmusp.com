# Uses
Here’s what’s in my digital toolbox — the gear I use to write code, craft interfaces and and stay productive.
## Editor + Terminal
- My main battlestation is **WebStorm** — unbeatable for TypeScript, Vue, and React work. For backend projects I switch over to **Rider** (C#/.NET) or **PHPStorm** (for those dusty old PHP projects).
- I'm currently experimenting with **Cursor** — AI-assisted coding is wild, and I'm curious where it'll fit into my dev flow.
- **Ghostty** is my current terminal of choice — sleek and minimal, just how I like it. Though I still have a soft spot for **iTerm2**.
- Browser of choice? **Chrome**. Because despite everything… it just works.

## Desktop Apps & Tools
- **BetterTouchTool** is my window management Swiss Army knife. I even mapped F13–F15 for maximum obscure key-flexing.
- **Raycast** is my command bar BFF. I barely touch my dock anymore.
- I’m a recovering Adobe power user (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, After Effects) — but these days, I’m learning to love **Figma** and its clean, collaborative vibes.
- **TablePlus** — clean and powerful SQL client for all my DB needs.
- **1Password X** — where I hide all my secrets, keys, and embarrassing test credentials I'll never admit to using in production.
- **MiniSim** & **Xcode** — my trusty mobile battlegrounds for breaking layouts and debugging scroll views.
- **Raindrop.io** — my digital treasure chest for saving articles, tools, inspiration, and the occasional meme disguised as research.


## Backup Strategy
- Local backups run via **Time Machine** to a **Synology NAS** — old-school but solid.
- Off-site backup? That’s handled by **Backblaze** — because I believe in backups of backups.

## Desk Setup
- My daily driver is a **13" Apple MacBook M1 MAX** with 32GB RAM — small size, big power.
- Plugged into a beautiful **27" Apple Studio Display**, aka my second brain.
- I sit like royalty on a **Herman Miller Aeron** chair — one of the smartest purchases I’ve made. Upgraded it with **Rollerblade wheels** because I like to glide into meetings. Shoutout to **Wes Bos** for that tip.
- The desk itself is a custom-cut countertop perched on an **IKEA standing gaming desk** frame — minimal and rock-solid.
- Keyboard: standard **Apple Magic Keyboard with numpad**. Mouse: **Magic Mouse 2**, love it or hate it.
- For sound, I’ve got **Pioneer DJ studio monitors** — perfect for deep focus or casual beat-making.
